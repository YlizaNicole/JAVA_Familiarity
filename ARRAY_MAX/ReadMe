This is lab activity requirement for Software Design/Engineering course. 

This Java program finds the maximum value in an array of integers.

This program takes an array of integers as input and iterates through the elements to find the maximum value. It uses a loop to compare each element with the current maximum value, updating the maximum value if a larger element is found. Finally, it outputs the maximum value to the console.


in accordance to the lesson where you will be the compiller the logic formalation is:

1. First element in the array will be assign to a variable named "max".
2. Iterate over the next elements in the array by comparing the elements and if an element is greater than "max"(the previous),it will update the value of "max" to element.
3. Print the maximum value
