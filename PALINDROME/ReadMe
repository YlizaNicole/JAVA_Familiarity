This is lab activity requirement for Software Design/Engineering course. 

This Java program creates a checker whether the word is a palindrome.

**the logic formalation is:**

1. Assign the original string to be checked if it is a palindrome.
2. Create an empty string for reversed.
3. Iterate the characters in the original string in reverse order(which was empty).
4. Compare the original and reversed strings.
5. if the result is the same then it will print 
The string is a palindrome.
if not then it will print
"The string is not a palindrome."
